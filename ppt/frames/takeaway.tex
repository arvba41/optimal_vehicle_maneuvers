        Optimizing for Max $v_f$, results in the pendulum turn. \newline However, it is not the fastest. At any point in time (not $t_0$), Min $t$ is always faster.

        Cannot say as of now! We need to do more analysis.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Improving the model to include the benefits of "pendulum turn". \par Incorporate a DT-model. \par Norminal forces at steady state on the wheel: \begin{align*}
            F_{z(i)} &= \frac{\mu m g \pm f(F_{x},F_y)}{L}, & \text{where }&  f(F_{x},F_y) \text{ should be a non-linear function.}
        \end{align*} \pause
        \item Rally cars are not the same as stock cars. \par Altering position of the center of gravity (affects LT). \pause
        \item Pendulum turn is more probable at low frictions (snow, gravel, etc.).
