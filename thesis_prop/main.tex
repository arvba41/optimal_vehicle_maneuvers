In recent years, the push towards electrifying transportation has gained significant traction, with battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) emerging as a viable alternative. However, the widespread adoption of BEVs faces multiple challenges, such as limited driving range, making powertrain efficiency improvements crucial. Over recent years, battery-integrated converters have gained popularity and have higher efficiency than conventional inverters. Furthermore, due to their modular nature, battery-integrated converters have improved battery life and also improve the range of EVs.
